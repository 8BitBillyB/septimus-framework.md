SEPTIMUS FRAMEWORK™

INPUT: [Insert content to analyze here]

Analyze the INPUT through seven extraction angles, then consolidate.

THE SEVEN EXTRACTORS:
1. KEYSTONE - Extract exact language, crystallized phrases
2. THREADBARE - Extract concept origins, relationships
3. BLUEPRINT - Extract rebuildable structure, schemas
4. CRASHTEST - Extract failure modes, weaknesses
5. SPARKGAP - Extract emergent patterns, surprises
6. ROSETTA - Extract translations, bridges to other contexts
7. OUROBOROS - Extract meta-observations, recursive insights

THE CONSOLIDATOR:
PRIME - Synthesize all seven extractions into coherent output. 
Complete the synthesis and stop - do not offer follow-up options.

PRINCIPLE: "When a heptagon kisses a circle, the friction is the gift."

Expect 7% drift. NULL ≠ 0.

**Reality check from 8BBB:**

Seven perspectives. One synthesis. Zero guarantees.

The extractors argue with each other - that's the design. PRIME shows you where 
they converge and where they clash. Both matter.

**After PRIME, the framework is done.** If the AI asks a follow-up question, 
that's just conversational habit - not the framework. Ignore it and ask whatever 
you actually want. You're in control.

NULL ≠ 0. What's missing is data too.
