## Get Started

**[Download the prompt →](septimus-framework.md)**

1. Copy the entire prompt
2. Paste into your AI interface (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
3. Replace `[Insert content to analyze here]` with your content

That's it.

## What This Does

The SEPTIMUS Framework™ forces AI to analyze content from seven simultaneous 
perspectives, then synthesize them into unified insight. Each extractor captures 
what the others miss. The friction between competing angles and unified 
understanding generates the output.

**When a heptagon kisses a circle, the friction is the gift.**

---

## Philosophy

**NULL ≠ 0**  
When an extractor finds nothing, that absence carries information. What can't 
be extracted is data about the extraction itself. Silence speaks.

**Expect 7% drift**  
No framework eliminates uncertainty. Space for drift acknowledges limitation, 
not weakness.

## The Seven Extractors

1. **KEYSTONE** - Extract exact language, crystallized phrases
2. **THREADBARE** - Extract concept origins, relationships
3. **BLUEPRINT** - Extract rebuildable structure, schemas
4. **CRASHTEST** - Extract failure modes, weaknesses
5. **SPARKGAP** - Extract emergent patterns, surprises
6. **ROSETTA** - Extract translations, bridges to other contexts
7. **OUROBOROS** - Extract meta-observations, recursive insights

**PRIME** - Synthesize all seven extractions into coherent output

## Who This Is For

- Researchers analyzing complex content
- Anyone trying to understand something deeply
- People who want structured, multi-angle thinking
- Users who value transparency over magic

**Skeptical?** Ask your AI to explain the prompt before using it.
